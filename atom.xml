    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="My-Food-Porn"><a href="#My-Food-Porn" class="headerlink" title="My Food Porn"></a>My Food Porn</h2><p>Hi everybody, or whoever is reading, thanks for checking out my blog - My Food Porn! If you like home cooked, comfort food from all over the world, I think you will love my food! I like to experiment with any kind of food,<br>including many types of Asian (Vietnamese, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) as well as Italian (I’m part Italian, so it kind of makes sense I guess lol) as well as Southern food (I’m from Georgia), so no matter what kind of food you<br>like you will probably see something here you like (at least I hope so) with simple, easy to follow instructions on how you can make these meals yourself! Keep note though; my recipes are bare bones.<br>They aren’t exact by any means because my personal philosophy is that crafting food is not only an art but an expression of a culture.<br>I want people who see these pictures to take stock of what’s said and seen and take it and run wild with it.<br>Take it and make it your own, because food is every human being’s right.</p>
<p>I hope to post pretty regularly, at least twice a week, if possible. I absolutely cannot wait to share my food with you and I sincerely hope<br>you enjoy reading about it as much as I enjoy cooking it!</p>
<p>Also, if you would like to see some pictures (this is My Food Porn right (:) feel free to check out my gallery <a href="https://plus.google.com/collection/gLv5lB" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
